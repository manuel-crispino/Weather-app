* This is my Weather app 

i have been build this Weather app to have a better understanding of API as a capstone Project 
i did not spend much time into more detailed styles is very basic and also a bit ugly.
was not meant to be perfect i wanted to concentrate more on Api this time !.

* Feel free to copy and make it better 

if you like we can work in this Project together.
this is the reason why i did not make it perfect so we can have some practice to collaborate 
down here i will tell you what you can upgrade .
i have also comment the index.js function so you have a better understanding on whats going on there .

* What can we Upgrade

** Images

there are some images i have not create like for mist weather and snow  feel free to find any images also to change the location or even change it all if you think would be better .

** Forecast for next days.

i only made the current time weather so you can upgrade for next days forecast here you can check the [API LINK DOCUMENTATION](https://openweathermap.org/api).

** Better design 

feel free to make it better is very basic right now as a said in my intro .

** Make it responsive 

we can also implement a nice mobile design .

* Message me 

if you want to Join the project i have created a Discord Group so we can talk [INVITATION LINK](https://discord.gg/aDDTPgnr).

* Last tips 

make sure when you paste this code into your vscode to install all the npm packages .
you don't have to make it all alone just complete one task is better when we work more developers in this project .
